# Recommendations
Basically anything I feel is a good recommendation for anything out there.

## Chrome

### Privacy/Security

* [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) - the only ad blocker you want. [My settings if you're curious](https://imgur.com/a/kW28CEL)
* [uBlock Origin Extra](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-extra/pgdnlhfefecpicbbihgmbmffkjpaplco?hl=en) - helps with anti-adblock
* [Nano Defender](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin) - similar to uBO Extra, but adds more, also helps with anti-adblock

* [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp) - tracker protection
* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en) - automatically switch to HTTPS

### Customization

* [Dynamic New Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chjlpggajdfaplimlgfmipjokhjdnakc) - if you want a wallpaper in your new tab that changes every n minutes. You can fetch wallpapers from your local directory or even an imgur gallery and so on.

## Security

* Windows Defender + common sense - don't click on suspicious links
* [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) - do a regular scan every now and then
* There are other tools that you can use to clean your PC when you know it's been severely infected, doing a search for those might prove more helpful for a case-to-case basis. A word of caution that some can break some things

## Maintenance

* [PC Decrapifier](https://www.pcdecrapifier.com/) - removes bloatware
* Disk Cleanup - yes, the default Windows one
* Defragment and Optimize Drives - yes, the default Windows one
* [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/) - exercise caution when cleaning registry, it shouldn't always be cleaned, and if you do, always save a backup
* [CCEnhancer](https://singularlabs.com/software/ccenhancer/) - a very useful add-on for CCleaner, adds more things to clean by CCleaner

## Tools

* [SpaceSniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/) - lets you visualize your disk space and see what occupies your space, I prefer this over WinDirStat, but that also has it's uses. I recommend running SpaceSniffer as admin.
