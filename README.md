# Recommendations
Basically anything I feel is a good recommendation for anything out there.

## Chrome

### Privacy/Security

* [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) - the only ad blocker you want
* [uBlock Origin Extra](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-extra/pgdnlhfefecpicbbihgmbmffkjpaplco?hl=en) - helps with anti-adblock
* [Nano Defender](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin) - similar to uBO Extra, but adds more, also helps with anti-adblock

### Customization

* [Dynamic New Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chjlpggajdfaplimlgfmipjokhjdnakc) - if you want a wallpaper in your new tab that changes every n minutes. You can fetch wallpapers from your local directory or even an imgur gallery and so on.
