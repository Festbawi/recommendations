# Chrome

## Privacy/Security

* [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) - the only ad blocker you want. [My settings if you're curious](https://imgur.com/a/kW28CEL)
* [uBlock Origin Extra](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-extra/pgdnlhfefecpicbbihgmbmffkjpaplco?hl=en) - helps with anti-adblock
* [Nano Defender](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin) - similar to uBO Extra, but adds more, also helps with anti-adblock

* [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp) - tracker protection
* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en) - automatically switch to HTTPS

## Customization

* [Dynamic New Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chjlpggajdfaplimlgfmipjokhjdnakc) - if you want a wallpaper in your new tab that changes every n minutes. You can fetch wallpapers from your local directory or even an imgur gallery and so on.

# Downloads

* [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org) - my go-to torrent client, you can easily google "qbittorrent vs utorrent" if you're curious
* [JDownloader 2](http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) - very useful, but a bit on the heavier side for memory usage, since it's Java-based, but shouldn't be much of a concern if you have 8+ GB RAM.

# Maintenance

* [PC Decrapifier](https://www.pcdecrapifier.com/) - removes bloatware
* Disk Cleanup - yes, the default Windows one
* Defragment and Optimize Drives - yes, the default Windows one
* [Defraggler](https://www.ccleaner.com/defraggler) - slower, but safer than default Windows
* [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/) - exercise caution when cleaning registry, it shouldn't always be cleaned, and if you do, always save a backup
* [CCEnhancer](https://singularlabs.com/software/ccenhancer/) - a very useful add-on for CCleaner, adds more things to clean by CCleaner. Exercise caution and check out what the new additions add before actually cleaning them in CCleaner.
* [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com/) - all in one tool set, including some cleaning tools, software updates, and so many more

# Media

* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) - good enough for most purposes, I don't use it though, since I use the ones mentioned below
* [AIMP](http://www.aimp.ru/) - I prefer this over VLC for playing music
* [mpv](https://mpv.io/) - My go-to for playing videos (anime mostly), not the most user friendly, interface isn't complete, no auto-update, not all features are there, but I'd still use it over VLC any day. It isn't a clear cut package too, so if you want Windows builds, you can find them [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files) or [here](https://mpv.srsfckn.biz/).

# Security

* Windows Defender + common sense - don't click on suspicious links
* [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) - do a regular scan every now and then
* There are other tools that you can use to clean your PC when you know it's been severely infected, doing a search for those might prove more helpful for a case-to-case basis. A word of caution that some can break some things

# Utilities

* [SpaceSniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/) - lets you visualize your disk space and see what occupies your space. I prefer this over [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/), but that also has it's uses since it shows you it in a list view. I recommend running SpaceSniffer as admin.
