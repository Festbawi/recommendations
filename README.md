⭐ - a personal necessity

# Android
* [Messages by Google](https://messages.google.com/) - messaging/texting app by Google, used to be meh before, but they added more features and practically changed the UI a lot, best thing about this is a web interface [here](https://messages.google.com/web/) to be able to send emails through web.
* [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi) - open source, no ads, easy to use manga reader + downloader. Supports a lot of sites as well. ⭐
* [Youtube Vanced](https://vanced.app/) - basically cracked Youtube, important: downloads, and **background playback** (i.e. play video/music while your phone screen's off or you're in another app) ⭐

# Chrome

## Customization

* [Dynamic New Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chjlpggajdfaplimlgfmipjokhjdnakc) - if you want a wallpaper in your new tab that changes every n minutes. You can fetch wallpapers from your local directory or even an imgur gallery and so on.
* [Iridium](https://github.com/ParticleCore/Iridium) - better Youtube, also available in userscript, and as a Chrome/Firefox extension
* [Audio Only Youtube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/audio-only-youtube/pkocpiliahoaohbolmkelakpiphnllog) - "Enables you to disable video streams on youtube and listen audio." Saves bandwidth as well, unlike other extensions that still load the video but just don't show it. Great if you're trying to save bandwidth, or you have a potato that lags with videos.

## Privacy/Security

* [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) - the only ad blocker you want. [My settings if you're curious](https://imgur.com/a/kW28CEL) ⭐
* [uBlock Origin Extra](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-extra/pgdnlhfefecpicbbihgmbmffkjpaplco?hl=en) - helps with anti-adblock ⭐
* [Nano Defender](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin) - similar to uBO Extra, but adds more, also helps with anti-adblock ⭐
* [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp) - tracker protection
* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en) - redirects you to HTTPS version of site if it exists, more complex and customizable, but heavier on memory usage vs Smart HTTPS
* [Smart HTTPS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-https/cmleijjdpceldbelpnpkddofmcmcaknm) - lighter on memory, see this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/66bhmd/https_everywhere_vs_smart_https/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

# Documents

* [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) - Simple and opens pdf files really fast, no additional features, my go-to PDF viewer. Doesn't have editing capabilities if you're going for that, but I'd still have this as default even if I did need to edit. ⭐

# Downloads

* [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org) - my go-to torrent client, you can easily google "qbittorrent vs utorrent" if you're curious. ⭐
* [JDownloader 2](http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) - very useful, but a bit on the heavier side for memory usage, since it's Java-based, but shouldn't be much of a concern if you have 8+ GB RAM. ⭐

# Maintenance

* [PC Decrapifier](https://www.pcdecrapifier.com/) - removes bloatware
* Disk Cleanup - yes, the default Windows one
* Defragment and Optimize Drives - yes, the default Windows one
* [Defraggler](https://www.ccleaner.com/defraggler) - slower, but safer than default Windows Defrag
* [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/) - exercise caution when cleaning registry, it shouldn't always be cleaned, and if you do, always save a backup ⭐
* [CCEnhancer](https://singularlabs.com/software/ccenhancer/) - a very useful add-on for CCleaner, adds more things to clean by CCleaner. Exercise caution and check out what the new additions add before actually cleaning them in CCleaner. ⭐
* [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com/) - all in one tool set, including some cleaning tools, software updates, and so many more

# Media

* [FastStone Image Viewer](http://www.faststone.org/) - My go-to default photo viewer. Opens fast, has quick editor capabilities, can be confusing at start but efficient when you learn it. ⭐
* [AIMP](http://www.aimp.ru/) - My go-to music player. ⭐
* [mpv](https://mpv.io/) - My go-to video player. Not the most user friendly, interface isn't complete, no auto-update, not all features are there, but I'd still use it. It isn't a clear cut package too, so if you want Windows builds, you can find them [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files) or [here](https://mpv.srsfckn.biz/). ⭐
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) - if you want an all-in-one music/video player that's more user-friendly than mpv, here ya go

# Programming

* [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) - Not software, but very useful article for organizing git branches, also search about semantic versioning if you're interested
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - yep ⭐
* [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases) - my favorite coding font ⭐
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - my preferred editor for when my machine has less than 8 GB RAM
* [Clink](https://mridgers.github.io/clink/) - Improved native Windows terminal
* [Gnu on Windows](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow) - unix command line utilities in native Windows terminal

## Artificial Intelligence

* [Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) - visualizes machine learning models, like those from Keras

# Security

* Windows Defender + common sense - don't click on suspicious links
* [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) - do a regular scan every now and then ⭐
* There are other tools that you can use to clean your PC when you know it's been severely infected, doing a search for those might prove more helpful for a case-to-case basis. A word of caution that some can break some things

# Utilities

* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - compression software, free and without ADS or those annoying purchase prompts ⭐
* [SpaceSniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/) - lets you visualize your disk space and see what occupies your space. I prefer this over [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/), but that also has it's uses since it shows you it in a list view. I recommend running SpaceSniffer as admin. ⭐
* [SpeedCrunch](https://speedcrunch.org/) - replaces the default Windows calculator, sleek, themes, more functions, easy shortcuts, loads fast. ⭐
* [CDBurnerXP](https://cdburnerxp.se/en/home) - simple to use CD/DVD burner, worked for me when Windows Explorer wouldn't
